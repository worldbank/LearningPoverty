SE.LPV.PRIM,Learning poverty: Share of Children at the End-of-Primary age below minimum reading proficiency adjusted by Out-of-School Children (%),Education Statistics,"This indicator brings together schooling and learning. It starts with the share of children who have not achieved minimum reading proficiency and adjusts it by the proportion of children who are out of school. The data used to calculate Learning Poverty has been made possible thanks to the work of the Global Alliance to Monitor Learning (GAML) led by the UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS), which established Minimum Proficiency Levels (MPLs) that enable countries to benchmark learning across different cross-national and national assessments.
