# Learning Poverty

This repository contains the analysis presented in the paper _“Will Every Child Be Able to Read by 2030? Why Eliminating Learning Poverty Will Be Harder Than You Think, and What to Do About It.”_ [1].

As a significant contributor to human capital deficits, the learning crisis undermines sustainable growth and poverty reduction. The paper introduces the new concept of _learning poverty_ and provides a synthetic indicator with global coverage to spotlight this crisis. _Learning poverty_ means being unable to read and understand a short, age-appropriate text by age 10. This indicator brings together schooling and learning by adjusting the proportion of kids in school below a proficiency threshold by the out-of-school population.

The new data show that **more than half of all children in World Bank client countries suffer from _learning poverty_** – the majority of them low- and middle-income countries. And progress in reducing _learning poverty_ is far too slow to meet the SDG aspirations: even if countries reduce their _learning poverty_ at the fastest rates we have seen so far in this century, the goal of ending it will not be attained by 2030.

## Technical Notes

Most of the data used to calculate _learning poverty_ comes from the **[Global Learning Assessment Database (GLAD)](https://github.com/worldbank/GLAD)**, a collection of harmonized datasets at the individual and country level. This harmonization has been made possible thanks to the leadership of the UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS), the custodian agency for SDG 4, in coordinating a Global Alliance for the Monitoring of Learning (GAML), and in establishing Minimum Proficiency Levels (MPLs) that enable countries to benchmark learning. Working with the UIS, we have built a consolidated global database representing 80% of the population of primary-age children globally.
