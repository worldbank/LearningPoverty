The Grade 6 English test covers reading, writing and grammar. 40% of the test is devoted to reading, 40% to writing, and 20% to grammar. | Rejected|

|ETH_1|2015|4|57.32|||Basic Level| Grade 4 National Assessment|Marguerite: fairly comfortable taking students scoring Basic or above as corresponding to our global definition of “minimum proficiency”, which would mean that 57.32% of Grade 4 students in Ethiopia reach the “minimum proficiency” level in reading. If we instead took Proficient or above as the cut off, then only 11.28% of students would reach the required level, which seems too harsh. If we don’t like either of those numbers, then the other option would be to go with the % of students reaching 50% or more correct on the test, which would give us 44.9% of students reaching “minimum proficiency”. | Rejected|
